# Hierarchical Clustering with a Broad Distance Threshold VS Graph Links from also_buy / also_view  

When it comes to grouping “related” products (earphones, covers, chargers, etc.), you have two very different signals you can lean on:

---

## 1. Hierarchical Clustering with a Broad Distance Threshold

### Pros

1. **Modality‐Agnostic**

   * Works on whatever embedding you feed it—text, image, or fused multimodal—so it naturally captures semantic or visual similarity even when co-purchase data is sparse.

2. **Global Consistency**

   * Every product lives in the same embedding space, so “related” clusters share unified similarity semantics. You don’t have to stitch together multiple graphs or heuristics.

3. **No Extra Data Required**

   * Only needs the product metadata/images you already have, so it’s easy to run even on new or cold-start items.

4. **Adjustable Granularity**

   * You can tune the broad threshold continuously—raising it will group more distantly related products, lowering it will tighten the definition of “related.”

### Cons

1. **Semantic vs. Functional Relations**

   * Embedding similarity may conflate “similar” (another phone model) with “related” (charging pad). You’ll need to carefully pick the threshold so that true accessories clump together without drowning out category siblings.

2. **Feature Bias**

   * If your embeddings lean heavily on visual/textual cues, you might miss relationships that only show up in user behavior (e.g. a protective case that’s rarely described in text or visually dissimilar).

3. **Scale and Complexity**

   * Computing a full linkage on tens or hundreds of thousands of items can be prohibitively slow/in‐memory intensive—especially if you need to re‐compute whenever you add new products.

## 2. Graph Links from `also_buy` / `also_view`

### Pros

1. **Behavior‐Driven Relations**

   * Directly encodes user behavior: if many people buy chargers right after phones, you’ll see a strong link—regardless of how similar they look or how descriptively their titles match.  
   
2. **Scalable Community Detection**

   * Graph clustering algorithms like Louvain or Leiden can handle millions of nodes and edges efficiently, producing “related” communities very quickly.

### Cons

1. **Data Sparsity & Cold Start**

   * Brand new or niche products with few purchases/views won’t have strong links, so they might be left as isolates or forced into the “similar” embedding clusters instead of the “related” graph clusters.

2. **No Semantic Interpretability**

   * You’ll know that a phone and a charger belong to the same community, but you can’t easily explain “why” in terms of features—only “because users co-purchased.”

3. **Graph Noise & Popularity Bias**

   * Best-selling accessories get linked to everything; you may need to normalize by node degree or apply edge-weight thresholds to prevent “hub” items (e.g. generic USB-C cables) from dominating unrelated communities.

## When to Use Which—or Both

* **Use Hierarchical Clustering** when you need a generative, interpretable notion of “related” based on product attributes and you can tolerate tuning thresholds manually.
* **Use Graph Links** when you want behavior-grounded recommendations, particularly for accessories, and you have sufficient interaction data.
* **Combine Them** by:

  1. **Intersecting**: Only call two products “related” if they land in the same broad‐threshold cluster *and* share a strong graph link.
  2. **Ensembling**: Fuse embedding similarity scores and co-purchase edge weights into a single affinity matrix, then run one clustering on that hybrid graph.

That way you capture both what products *are* (their features) and what users *do* (their behavior).



# Embeddings (text-only vs image-only vs fused multimodal)  

Each embedding type brings different strengths—and for a “three-tier” clustering (identical vs. similar vs. related) you’ll almost always get the best overall fidelity from **fused multimodal vectors**, but let’s break down the trade-offs:

---

### 1. Text-Only Embeddings

* **What they capture**: Semantic metadata (titles, descriptions, specs).
* **Strengths**:

  * Excellent at grouping products with nearly identical text (e.g. “iPhone 15 Pro 256 GB Silver”) → high precision on “identical” clusters.
  * Fast to compute at scale (TF-IDF, BERT sentence embeddings).
* **Limitations**:

  * Misses purely visual distinctions (e.g. color variants, packaging differences).
  * Can’t spot similarity when text is sparse or noisy (many accessories share generic titles).

### 2. Image-Only Embeddings

* **What they capture**: Visual appearance, form factor, color, packaging.
* **Strengths**:

  * Great at clustering visually identical items and spotting near-duplicates (e.g. same phone case from different sellers).
  * Robust when text is missing or uninformative.
* **Limitations**:

  * May group different models that look alike (e.g. Galaxy S24 vs. S23) into the same cluster → lowers “identical” precision.
  * Misses semantic relationships (e.g. “wireless charger” vs. “charging pad” look different but are conceptually identical).

### 3. Fused Multimodal Embeddings

* **What they capture**: Both semantic and visual signals (e.g. via CLIP-style encoders or late-fusion).
* **Strengths**:

  * **Best of both worlds**:

    * Text disambiguates visually similar but semantically different items (e.g. two chargers with different wattages).
    * Images catch visual variants not spelled out in text.
  * Yields cleaner separations at **all three levels**:

    1. **Tight clusters** of identical SKUs,
    2. **Medium clusters** of category siblings (all smartphones),
    3. **Looser clusters** of related accessories.
* **Considerations**:

  * More computational overhead (need to encode both modalities + fusion step).
  * Requires good alignment—ideally a pretrained multimodal model (e.g. CLIP or a custom fine-tuned dual encoder).

#### Recommendation

* **Start with fused embeddings** (e.g. pool a CLIP model’s 512-D joint space).
* **Validate**:

  * Run a small-scale ablation: cluster on text-only, image-only, and fused, then measure purity for “identical” (near-duplicate detection) and recall for “related” (accessories).
  * You’ll almost always see fused vectors outperform single modalities in a balanced precision–recall tradeoff.

Once you confirm that fusion helps on your “Cell Phones & Accessories” slice, you can tune the weighting between text vs. image channels (e.g. concatenation vs. learned gating) to eke out the best clustering across all three granularities.
